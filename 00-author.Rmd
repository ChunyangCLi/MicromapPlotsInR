# About the Author {-}

J&uuml;rgen Symanzik is a Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at
Utah State University in Logan, Utah, USA.

I need to check with CRC Press how to introduce all the chapter authors, 
e.g., via a few lines of text or by listing them by name and indicating
the affiliations (and e-mail addresses).
